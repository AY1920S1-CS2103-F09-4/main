== Introduction

Insurelytics is for insurance agents who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing contacts and policies*.
More importantly, Insurelytics is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
If you can type fast, Insurelytics can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.
Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!
