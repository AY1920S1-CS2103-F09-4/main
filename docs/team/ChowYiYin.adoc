== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *features to complement input validation to ease the correction of invalid commands*
** What it does: allows merging of duplicate profiles and policies and also gives suggestions for incorrectly entered command words.
** Justification: this feature improves the product significantly because a user can make mistakes in commands and the app provides a convenient way to rectify them.
Specifically, information does not have be re-entered after discovering a duplicate profile/policy. Additionally, typos can be corrected quickly through command suggestions.
** Highlights: this enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in the future. The list of command words and prefixes has to be updated when new commands are added for the suggestion of commands.
Moreover, the information used to create a duplicate profile/policy has to be stored to carry out a merge process and hence made the design process challenging.

* *Minor enhancement*: added a command to turn suggestions on and off.
